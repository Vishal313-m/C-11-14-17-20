In C++, a "literal" refers to data that is directly presented in the code, rather than being stored in a variable or accessed through a function call. 
It represents constant values that are fixed and unmodifiable throughout the program's execution. 
Examples of literals in C++ include integers like 42, floating-point numbers such as 3.14, characters like 'a', strings enclosed in double quotes like "hello world," 
and boolean values like true or false. Literals play a crucial role in initializing variables, specifying values in expressions, and conveying data directly within the source code, 
enhancing readability and maintainability
.



Literals In C/C++
Literals in programming, whether in C or C++, are indeed constant values assigned to variables that remain fixed and unmodifiable 
throughout the program’s execution. Unlike variables, literals are not associated with references and directly hold their values in memory. 
In common usage, the terms “constants” and “literals” are often used interchangeably.

For instance, consider the expression “const int x = 5;,” where the value 5 is a constant integer literal. In the world of C,
 there are four primary types of literals, while in C++, there are five:

Integer Literal: Used to represent whole numbers, such as 42.
Float Literal: Represents decimal numbers with a fractional part, like 3.14.
Character Literal: Represents a single character enclosed in single quotes, such as 'A'.
String Literal: Represents a sequence of characters enclosed in double quotes, like "Hello, World!".
Boolean Literal (C++): Represents either true or false, indicating logical values in C++.


A literal is some data that's presented directly in the code, rather than indirectly through a variable or function call.

Here are some examples, one per line:

42
128
3.1415
'a'
"hello world"
The data constituting a literal cannot be modified by a program, but it may be copied into a variable for further use:

int a = 42;  // creates variable `a` with the same value as the literal `42`
This concept is by no means unique to C++.

The term "literal" comes from the fact that you've written data literally into your program, i.e. exactly as written, not "hidden" behind a variable name.
