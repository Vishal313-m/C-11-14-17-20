Aggregates in C++ refer to types like arrays, structs, and classes that lack user-declared constructors. 
These types can be initialized using aggregate initialization, which involves enclosing their components in braces.
Here's an example of aggregate initialization with a struct:


struct Person {
    std::string name;
    int age;
    std::string address;
};

int main() {
    // Aggregate initialization of a Person struct
    Person p1 { "John", 33, "New York" };

    std::cout << "Name: " << p1.name << std::endl;
    std::cout << "Age: " << p1.age << std::endl;
    std::cout << "Address: " << p1.address << std::endl;

    return 0;
}



In this example, the Person struct is an aggregate type, as it lacks any user-declared constructors.
 We can initialize a Person object p1 using aggregate initialization by enclosing the values for the member variables in braces { "John", 33, "New York" }.
Aggregate initialization can also be used with classes, as long as the class lacks user-declared constructors:


class Date {
public:
    int year;
    int month;
    int day;
};

int main() {
    // Aggregate initialization of a Date object
    Date d { 2023, 4, 29 };

    std::cout << "Year: " << d.year << std::endl;
    std::cout << "Month: " << d.month << std::endl;
    std::cout << "Day: " << d.day << std::endl;

    return 0;
}


In this case, the Date class is an aggregate type, and we can initialize a Date object d using aggregate initialization.
Aggregate initialization is a concise and efficient way to initialize objects in C++, as it bypasses the need to call constructors explicitly. 
It also provides flexibility, as you can selectively initialize certain members while leaving others to their default values.
The search results also mention that C++20 has extended the capabilities of aggregate initialization, allowing for more complex aggregate initialization, 
including setting up non-static data members of a class using a concise syntax.
