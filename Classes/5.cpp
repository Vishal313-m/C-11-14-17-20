Explanation of Header Guards
Header guards in C and C++ are used to prevent a header file from being included more than once in a translation unit. 
his is important to avoid issues like multiple definitions of functions, variables, or types, which can lead to compilation errors.



When a header file is included in multiple source files, without header guards, it can result in redefinition errors during compilation. 
To prevent this, the #ifndef, #define, and #endif preprocessor directives are used.


#ifndef: Stands for "if not defined." It checks if a particular identifier 
(usually the header file name in all caps) has not been defined before.

#define: If the identifier is not defined, this directive defines it. 
This is typically followed by the identifier that acts as a unique token for the header file.

#endif: Closes the conditional block started by #ifndef. 
This ensures that the contents of the header file are only included once in a translation unit.

By using header guards, you ensure that even if a header file is included multiple times in 
different parts of the code, its contents are processed only once, preventing redefinition errors 
and maintaining the integrity of the program's structure.
