C++ Core Language: This refers to the fundamental syntax, semantics, and features of the C++ programming language itself. 
It includes concepts like classes, inheritance, polymorphism, templates, and other language-specific constructs that are part of the core C++ language definition.


C++ Standard Library: The C++ Standard Library is a collection of classes and functions that are written in the core language and are part of the C++ ISO Standard itself. 
It provides generic containers, functions for manipulating these containers, function objects, strings, streams, support for language features, 
and everyday tasks like file I/O operations. The C++ Standard Library is a standardized set of functionalities that are available to all C++ programmers.Like#include<iostream>


STL (Standard Template Library): The STL is a subset of the C++ Standard Library that consists of containers, algorithms, functions, and iterators.
 It provides a framework of data structures and algorithms accepted as part of the C++ standard.
  The STL influenced many parts of the C++ Standard Library, but it is not explicitly mentioned in the C++ standard. 
  The STL contains sequence containers, associative containers, and iterators that allow programmers to work with collections of data efficiently.
