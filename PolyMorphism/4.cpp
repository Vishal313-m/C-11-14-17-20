/*OBJECT SLICING*/
/* When a derived class object is assigned to a base class object in C++, the derived class objectâ€™s extra attributes are sliced off (not considered) 
to generate the base class object; and this whole process is termed object slicing.*

-- 
In C++, object slicing occurs when you assign a derived class object to a base class object, resulting in the loss of derived class-specific information.
