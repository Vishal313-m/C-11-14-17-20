A const member function in C++ is a function that is declared with the const keyword after the function name in the class declaration. 
It signifies that the function will not modify any of the class's data members.



Here are the key points about const member functions:
They are used to ensure that the object's state is not modified by the function. This is useful for providing read-only access to the object's data.

They can be called on both const and non-const objects. However, non-const member functions can only be called on non-const objects.

Inside a const member function, you cannot modify any non-static data members of the class unless they are also declared as mutable.

Const member functions are typically used for getter methods that return the values of data members without modifying them.

The const keyword is part of the function's signature, so you can overload a function based on whether it is const or non-const.

Here's an example of a const member function:


class MyClass {
public:
    int getValue() const {
        return value;
    }

    void setValue(int val) {
        value = val;
    }

private:
    int value;
};


In this example, getValue() is a const member function that returns the value of the value data member without modifying it. 
The setValue() function is non-const and can modify the value.
Using const member functions helps prevent accidental modifications to the object's state and makes the code more robust and maintainable
